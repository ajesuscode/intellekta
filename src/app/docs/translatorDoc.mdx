# Using the translator tool

## Getting Started

### 1. Enter Your Text

-   Look for a big box saying "Paste text here and Ai will detect language".
-   Type or paste the text you want to translate there.

### 2. Choose Your Language

-   Below your text, there's a dropdown menu. It's set to "Ukrainian" by default.
-   Click on it and pick the language you want the text translated to.

### 3. Get Your Translation

-   Press the `translate` button next to the box where you entered your text.
-   Wait a moment, and your translation will appear below in a neat card.

### 4. Copy Your Translation

-   See the paper icon on the top-right corner of the translation card? Click it!
-   Your translation is now copied and ready to be pasted wherever you need.

## Handy Tips

-   For best results, avoid super long paragraphs.
-   Make sure you're connected to the internet.
-   Remember, it's a machine doing the translation, so it might not always get idioms or slang.

## Wrapping Up

And that's it! You're now ready to use the Translator Tool anytime you need. Happy translating!
