# How to Use the Language Tutor Page

Hello there! Need help with grammar, conjugation, or rules? You're in the right place. Here's a quick guide on how to use our Language Tutor.

## 📝 Asking Questions

1. **Find the text box**

    - It's right below the section where the tutor tells you about their capabilities.
    - It looks like a blank space waiting for your text!

2. **Type in your question or text**

    - This could be anything from a sentence you want to be corrected, a verb you need help conjugating, or a grammar rule you're curious about.

3. **Hit the "ASK" button**
    - Located right below the text box.
    - If the button is busy with little dots, that means the tutor is thinking, so give it a moment!

## 📖 Reading the Response

-   Once you've asked your question, just wait a moment.
-   The tutor's response will appear below in a neat section. Scroll down if you've asked a lengthy question and the response is long.

## 💡 Helpful Tips

-   **Be Specific**: The clearer your question, the better the tutor can assist you.
-   **Short and Sweet**: While the tutor is capable, shorter sentences or questions can often get clearer answers.
-   **Try Different Questions**: If you're not getting the answer you want, try asking in a different way!

That's all there is to it! Dive in, and happy learning!
