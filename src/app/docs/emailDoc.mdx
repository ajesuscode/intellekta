## 🧹 Managing Templates

### 1. **Deleting a Template**

-   If you want to delete a template, look for the **trash bin icon** at the top right corner of each template box.
-   Click on it and your template will be deleted.

### 2. **Viewing Generated Emails**

-   After generating an email, you can view the results by clicking on the **title** that appears above the "Generate Email" button.
-   This will expand the section, allowing you to see the full content of the generated email.

## 🔔 Notifications

-   Occasionally, you might see a message pop up at the top. This is our way of communicating with you. For instance, if you try to generate an email without any content, we'll let you know.

That's all! We hope this helps you craft the perfect emails for your needs. If you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask. Happy writing! 📝
